# Real User Monitoring

The purpose of Real User Monitoring is to provide transparency about the usage (executions) and the performance (response times) of user interactions. It supports the monitoring request executions from different platforms with a unified user experience using a common look-and-feel and handling pattern. 

The basic concept is to get all user interactions and relevant server requests correlated in the Real User Monitoring application. Request executions are rated not based on fixed thresholds but on historical values.

Real User Monitoring shall help IT and Business users understand how often applications are executed and the response times for end users.
